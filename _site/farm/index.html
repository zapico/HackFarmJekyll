  <h1 class="page-title">The Farm</h1>
  <p>The Hack Farm is based on a 2,2 ha (5,5 acres) smallholding in Småland, Sweden, 198 meters above sea level.
<img src="/public/pictures/farmplan.jpg" alt="Farm Plan" />
The farm is divided in different sectors:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Main production garden</strong>:
This area is the main powerhouse of the farm, maintained in a minimun/no-till system with permanent beds. The whole area is surrounded by a slug fence and has a permanent irrigation system with sprinklers. Around 25% is planted with perennial crops such as blueberries, asparagus, herbs, strawberries, roses.. Other 25% is usually planted with a rotation of cover crops. Inside this area there are two polytunnels of 80m2 and 30m2. The hens are rotated through the garden in a chicken tractor to clean-up and fertilise.</li>
  <li><strong>Fruit orchard</strong>
The orchard is planted as an agroforestry alley cropping system with seven rows of mixed trees and bushes under growth including: a) Fruit: apple, quinces, mullberry, plums, peaches, pear; b) Berries: blueberries, gooseberries, aronia, rubus… c) Nuts: hazelnuts d) Functional: the above are interplanted with functional and ornamental bushes like siberian pea shrub, magnolias, rowans…
The fruit orchard also houses our beehives.</li>
  <li><strong>Nut forest</strong>
This area is planted with (eventually) taller nut trees such as chestnut, walnut, beech, hickory.. interplanted with bushes. It connects with the existing border of oaks and maples.</li>
  <li><strong>Paddocks</strong>
Two areas are at the moment left as paddocks for grazing.</li>
  <li><strong>Riparian zone</strong>
The lowest level of the farm is an alder forest in the riparian zone of a creek. Ducks live here to keep slugs in check. Further away from the creek the alders are coppiced for biomass (ramial wood chips, biochar, wood for mushroom cultivation…).</li>
</ol>

The vegetables have been sold as a CSA under <a href="http://nybrukarna.se/">Nybrukarna</a> with weekly boxes delivered locally. Honey and eggs are sold at the farm. Under 2022 focus is on <a href="/seeds">seed production for Nordfrö.</a>.</p>
