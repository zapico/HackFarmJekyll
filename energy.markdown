## Solar power
The farm has a solar system with 48x270W panels for a total of 13kw effect installed in 2018.

## Monitoring and control
With solar panels and an hourly-based tariff, we are exploring dynamic changes to electricity consumption in time based on prize and availability. A prototype was created to show real time consumption/production and spot prize and placed in the farm kitchen. This always visible information is then used for informing energy decisions (charging car, using tools, washing, using the oven..).

## Solar servers
We are running two web servers on solar energy. An offgrid setup with a solar panel, battery and 12v MPPT connected to a raspberry pi zero 2 (This site is hosted on that setup). An ongrid setup with an HPE server running only when solar energy is available from the main system and switching to a raspberry pi on PoE when not.
