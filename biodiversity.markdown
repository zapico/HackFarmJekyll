Increasing and maintaining biodiversity is a main objective for the farm, focusing in biodiversity of cultivated [germplasm](/seeds) and biodiversity of wild insets with special focus on pollinators (*Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Coleoptera*). Main efforts are on providing habitat (undisturbed sites, deadwood, edge zones..) and a variety of feeding opportunities throughout the season.

## Sensing biodiversity
We are working with the [LNU IoT-lab]() to explore how low-powered sensors and tiny-ML can be used for detecting and classifying species in the field for measuring population size and diversity. Read more about the ideas in this [conference paper](). Current test to be run during 2022 include:
1. Using [audiomoth](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/) to record bird songs and identify birds and bats. Birds can be used as a proxy for general biodiversity status.
2. Using Arduino portenta with Lora running to identify birds using [BirNET-Lite](https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Lite)
3. Using Machine Vision for identifying and classifying flying pollinators.
