The farm is divided in different sectors:
1. **Main production garden**:
This area is the main powerhouse of the farm, maintained in a minimun/no-till system with permanent beds. The whole area is surrounded by a slug fence and has a permanent irrigation system with sprinklers. Around 25% is planted with perennial crops such as blueberries, asparagus, herbs, strawberries, roses.. Other 25% is usually planted with a rotation of cover crops. Inside this area there are two polytunnels of 80m2 and 30m2. The hens are rotated through the garden in a chicken tractor to clean-up and fertilise.  
2. **Fruit orchard**
The orchard is planted as an agroforestry alley cropping system with seven rows of mixed trees and bushes under growth including: a) Fruit: apple, quinces, mullberry, plums, peaches, pear; b) Berries: blueberries, gooseberries, aronia, rubus... c) Nuts: hazelnuts d) Functional: the above are interplanted with functional and ornamental bushes like siberian pea shrub, magnolias, rowans...
The fruit orchard also houses our beehives.
3. **Nut forest**
This area is planted with (eventually) taller nut trees such as chestnut, walnut, beech, hickory.. interplanted with bushes. It connects with the existing border of oaks and maples.
4. **Paddocks**
Two areas are at the moment left as paddocks for grazing.
5. **Riparian zone**
The lowest level of the farm is an alder forest in the riparian zone of a creek. Ducks live here to keep slugs in check. Further away from the creek the alders are coppiced for biomass (ramial wood chips, biochar, wood for mushroom cultivation...).
